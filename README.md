# calendar-schedule


Description

The motivation for this project is to allow users to create a daily schedule.

I built this project to solve a need for people who want to electronically schedule their business day.

This project shows off my skills working with JavaScript and Jquery.

I learned a lot about Jquery and other components like dayjs, local storage, and if/else statements
